= MediaWiki Plugin for Laconica v0.1 =

Converts MediaWiki-style freelinks into Wiki links:

    This status message was written by [[Evan Prodromou]].

would convert "[[Evan Prodromou]]" into a link to the Wiki of your
choice.

== Installation ==

Copy MediaWikiPlugin.php into the plugins directory.

Edit WIKI_BASE_URL in MediaWiikiPlugin.php to point to your Wiki's
base URL.

Add the following to config.php:

    require_once('plugins/MediaWikiPlugin.php');
    $wl = new MediaWikiPlugin();

Enjoy!

== To Do ==

This was my first PHP script, and I didn't spend a lot of time trying
to figure out PHP. There are a bunch of things I'd like to do better,
and I welcome advice on making it better.

  * Make preg_replace_callback call a MediaWikiPlugin method rather
    than a function. This would allow people to specify the
    WIKI_BASE_URL in the constructor rather than have to edit the
    plugin itself.

  * You could potentially use this plugin to support Wiki formatting:
    bold, italics, you name it. Not sure this is desirable, but it
    would be easy enough.

  * May need some additional escaping in the Wiki link parsing. It's
    pretty dumb right now.
